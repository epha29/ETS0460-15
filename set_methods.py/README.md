# set methods of python

# set.difference()
The difference() method returns a new set that contains all the items that are present in the first set but not in the second. Itâ€™s like finding the difference between two sets.
        
        what is the syntax?

set1.difference(set2)

# set.difference_update()

Modifies the original set by removing all elements that are also present in one or more other sets/sets

The difference_update() method is different from the difference() method, because the difference() method returns a new set, without the unwanted items, and the difference_update() method removes the unwanted items from the original set.
             
             what is the syntax?

set.difference_update(*others)
